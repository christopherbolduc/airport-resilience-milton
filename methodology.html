    <h1>Methodology</h1>
    <p>How the Airport Resilience Score was built and calculated</p>
  </header>
  <main>
    <section>
      <h2>Analytical Approach</h2>
      <p>To evaluate airport resilience during Hurricane Milton (Oct 2024), I sourced daily flight operations and weather data across five Florida airports. The goal was to measure how well each airport recovered, not just how badly it was hit.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Key Metrics</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Days to recovery</strong> — Time until flight volume and cancellations returned to near-normal</li>
        <li><strong>Cancellation rate</strong> — Total flight cancellations during October</li>
        <li><strong>Peak wind speed</strong> — Used to normalize for storm severity using square-root scaling</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Resilience Score Formula</h2>
      <p>The final score balances operational disruption and storm intensity:</p>
      <pre><code>resilience_score = (
    (days_to_recovery + (pct_cancelled * 10)) /
    ((peak_wind_speed_kmh ** 0.5) / 10)
)</code></pre>
      <p>Higher scores indicate worse performance. The formula is designed to fairly compare recovery, adjusting for how hard each airport was hit.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Tools Used</h2>
      <p><strong>Languages:</strong> Python, SQL</p>
      <p><strong>Libraries:</strong> Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SQLAlchemy, Meteostat</p>
      <p><strong>Environment:</strong> Jupyter Notebook, PostgreSQL (DBeaver), Git/GitHub</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data Sources</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>BTS (Bureau of Transportation Statistics)</strong> — Historical flight operations and cancellations</li>
        <li><strong>Meteostat API</strong> — Hourly and daily weather data by airport</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>SQL View Structure</h2>
      <p>To manage complexity, SQL views were structured in 3 layers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Staging</strong> — Raw table wrappers</li>
        <li><strong>Prep</strong> — Cleaned and engineered features</li>
        <li><strong>Mart</strong> — Final analytical dataset used in notebooks and reporting</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Notebook Analysis</h2>
      <p>The resilience score was calculated in a Jupyter Notebook using prepared SQL views. Charts and visuals were created with Matplotlib and Seaborn, and key metrics were exported to CSV for use in reports and dashboards.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Reproducibility</h2>
      <p>Anyone can recreate the analysis by cloning the repository, installing dependencies from <code>requirements.txt</code>, and running <code>ap_resilience.ipynb</code> with the proper source data in place.</p>
